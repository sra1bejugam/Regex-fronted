## RegexGenerator 
:point_right: RegexGenerator Is an Application where we can get the regex patterns by simply passing the **text/number/any special characters** or **multiple texts/numbers/any special characters** with some flags like **case sensitive**, **global**, and also in which format you need pattern(either in **words**, **dates** or in **normal form**).
